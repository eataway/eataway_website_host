                                you are legally capable of entering into binding contracts. Persons wishing to order
                                alcohol or tobacco products from any of our Partner Restaurants must be aged 18 or
                                older. By placing an order for Alcohol or Tobacco products with our Partner
                                Restaurants you are thereby confirming that you are 18 or older. If you make an
                                order for Alcohol or Tobacco products, the restaurant has the right to require you
                                to show ID on delivery. EatAway and/or the Restaurant reserve the right to cancel
                                orders containing Alcohol and/or Tobacco products if the customer is unable to prove

                                restaurant, therefore if your order contains Alcohol or Tobacco EatAway is not
                                selling these products to you. EatAway supports the Responsible Service of
                                Alcohol.</p>

                            <p style="text-align:justify;"><u>Making and order</u>:&nbsp;To make an order through

                                selected Restaurant and provide all required information, you will then be given the
                                option to make your order by clicking “checkout” on the English version and the
                                equivalent translation on the Chinese version. When the order is accepted by the
                                restaurant you will receive a notification that your order is “has been accepted”.
                                The contract for the supply of the meal(s) ordered through our service between you
                                and the Partner Restaurant will be formed once you have received the notification
                                that your order has been accepted. Once the restaurant has accepted your order, the
                                restaurant has sole responsibility for your order. You (the Customer) must resolve
                                any dispute regarding your Order directly with the Restaurant. In some cases EatAway
                                may intervene to resolve the dispute as a gesture of goodwill. We work closely with
                                Partner Restaurants and it is extremely important that they adhere to our standards
                                and help us maintain our reputation. Please contact us via email or telephone if you
                                have any comments relating our Partner Restaurants.</p>
                            <p style="text-align:justify;"><u>Changing an Order</u>:&nbsp;Once your order has been
                                submitted and accepted by the restaurant you will not be able to change or cancel
                                your order on our mobile Application. If you wish to change or cancel your order it
                                is your responsibility to directly contact the Restaurant or phone our customer
                                support team who will attempt contact the restaurant on your behalf. However there
                                is no guarantee that the Restaurant will agree to change or cancel the order as they
                                may have already started to prepare your order.</p>
                            <p style="text-align:justify;"><u>Restaurant failure to accept order</u>:&nbsp;Once your
                                order has been received we will process your order and send it to the Restaurant.
                                When your selected restaurant has accepted the order you will receive a notification
                                alerting you that the order “has been received”. You can view how your order is
                                processing at any time through the application. Restaurants have the option to
                                decline orders at any time due to weather conditions, because they are too busy or
                                any other reasons. We strongly encourage all Partner Restaurants to accept all
                                Orders and to communicate directly with the Customer prior to declining any order.
                                In the case that the restaurant does reject your order we will notify you (generally
                                via the APP) as soon as possible.</p>
                            <p style="text-align:justify;"><u>Delivery of order</u>:&nbsp;Estimations for delivery
                                times are provided by the restaurants and can be viewed on our Application. These
                                delivery times are only estimates and unfortunately sometimes things do not go to
                                plan because factors such as weather, traffic conditions and other unforeseen
                                circumstances may prevent restaurants from achieving their targeted delivery time.
                                Therefore neither EatAway nor the Restaurants can guarantee that the food will be
                                delivered within the estimated time. EatAway is not responsible for any complaints
                                about Restaurants or the products they provide. All orders placed via our service
                                are prepared and delivered by the Restaurant; all food preparation deliveries are
                                the sole responsibility of the restaurant accepting the order. To the full extent
                                permitted by Australian law, EatAway accepts no liability in the food preparation
                                and delivery undertaken by the Restaurant accepting the order.</p>
