                                <p style="text-align:justify;">By placing an order through our Service, you agree that you are legally capable of entering
                                    into binding contracts. Persons wishing to order alcohol or tobacco products from any
                                    of our Partner Restaurants must be aged 18 or older. By placing an order for Alcohol
                                    or Tobacco products with our Partner Restaurants you are thereby confirming that you
                                    are 18 or older. If you make an order for Alcohol or Tobacco products, the restaurant
                                    has the right to require you to show ID on delivery. EatAway and/or the Restaurant reserve
                                    the right to cancel orders containing Alcohol and/or Tobacco products if the customer
                                    is unable to prove they are 18 or older. For clarity, all orders are prepared and delivered
                                    by the restaurant, therefore if your order contains Alcohol or Tobacco EatAway is not
                                    selling these products to you. EatAway supports the Responsible Service of Alcohol.

                                    would like to order from the menu of your selected Restaurant and provide all required
                                    information, you will then be given the option to make your order by clicking “checkout”
                                    on the English version and the equivalent translation on the Chinese version. When the
                                    order is accepted by the restaurant you will receive a notification that your order is
                                    “has been accepted”. The contract for the supply of the meal(s) ordered through our service
                                    between you and the Partner Restaurant will be formed once you have received the notification
                                    that your order has been accepted. Once the restaurant has accepted your order, the restaurant
                                    has sole responsibility for your order. You (the Customer) must resolve any dispute regarding
                                    your Order directly with the Restaurant. In some cases EatAway may intervene to resolve
                                    the dispute as a gesture of goodwill. We work closely with Partner Restaurants and it
                                    is extremely important that they adhere to our standards and help us maintain our reputation.

                                    you will not be able to change or cancel your order on our mobile Application. If you
                                    wish to change or cancel your order it is your responsibility to directly contact the
                                    Restaurant or phone our customer support team who will attempt contact the restaurant
                                    on your behalf. However there is no guarantee that the Restaurant will agree to change

                                    <u>Restaurant failure to accept order</u>:&nbsp;Once your order has been received we will
                                    process your order and send it to the Restaurant. When your selected restaurant has accepted
                                    the order you will receive a notification alerting you that the order “has been received”.
                                    You can view how your order is processing at any time through the application. Restaurants
                                    have the option to decline orders at any time due to weather conditions, because they
                                    are too busy or any other reasons. We strongly encourage all Partner Restaurants to accept
                                    all Orders and to communicate directly with the Customer prior to declining any order.
                                    In the case that the restaurant does reject your order we will notify you (generally
                                    via the APP) as soon as possible.</p>

                                    <u>Delivery of order</u>:&nbsp;Estimations for delivery times are provided by the restaurants
                                    and can be viewed on our Application. These delivery times are only estimates and unfortunately
                                    sometimes things do not go to plan because factors such as weather, traffic conditions
                                    and other unforeseen circumstances may prevent restaurants from achieving their targeted
                                    delivery time. Therefore neither EatAway nor the Restaurants can guarantee that the food
                                    will be delivered within the estimated time. EatAway is not responsible for any complaints
                                    about Restaurants or the products they provide. All orders placed via our service are
                                    prepared and delivered by the Restaurant; all food preparation deliveries are the sole
                                    responsibility of the restaurant accepting the order. To the full extent permitted by
                                    Australian law, EatAway accepts no liability in the food preparation and delivery undertaken
                                    by the Restaurant accepting the order.</p>
